# DOBS ‚Äì Digital Occurrence Book System (Capstone Project)

## üìå Project Overview
The **Digital Occurrence Book System (DOBS)** is a web-based API built with **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**.  
It is designed to replace traditional paper-based occurrence books used in security, policing, and control room environments.  

The system allows operators to:
- Log incidents (occurrences) in real time.  
- Manage users with role-based access (Operator, Supervisor, Administrator).  
- Upload evidence such as images.  
- Search, filter, and organize records for quick retrieval.  
- Secure the platform with authentication, permissions, and API best practices.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework  
- **Database:** SQLite (for development)  
- **Auth:** JWT Authentication (SimpleJWT)  
- **Security:** CSRF, Django security middleware, DRF permissions  
- **Testing:** Django Test Framework & DRF test client  
- **Deployment-ready:** Compatible with Nginx/Apache setups  

---

## üë• User Roles
- **Operator** ‚Üí Create and view occurrences they log.  
- **Supervisor** ‚Üí Review, edit, and filter occurrences across the system.  
- **Administrator** ‚Üí Full system access, including managing users and permissions.  

---

## üîë Authentication
- JWT-based authentication (using **SimpleJWT**).  
- Endpoints for login, logout, and token refresh.  
- Users must authenticate to access most resources.  

---

## üìÇ Apps Breakdown
### 1. **Accounts App**
- Custom user model (with `date_of_birth`, `profile_photo`, and `role`).  
- Endpoints for registration, login, logout.  
- JWT integration for authentication.  

### 2. **Occurrences App**
- Core app for managing incident records.  
- Fields: `title`, `description`, `category`, `location`, `date_reported`, `status`, `reported_by`.  
- Supports image/file uploads.  
- Role-based access control.  

### 3. **Reports App**
- Generate structured reports based on filters (e.g., date, category).  
- Export-ready endpoints (future scope).  

### 4. **Posts (Social Media-style Updates)**
- Allow users to share quick updates, with comment support.  
- Linked to user authentication.  

---

## üîç Search & Filtering
Implemented **DRF filters + full-text search**:  
- **Search fields:** `title`, `description`, `location`, `category`.  
- **Filter fields:** `date_reported`, `status`, `category`.  
- Example query:  
  ```http
  GET /api/occurrences/?search=theft&category=Crime&date_reported=2025-08-01
  ```

---

## üîê Security Settings
- CSRF protection enabled for browsable API.  
- Secure headers applied via Django middleware:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`  
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`  
  - `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`  
- HTTPS-ready configuration for deployment.  
- Permissions enforced at endpoint level (Operators can‚Äôt see all logs, Admins can).  

---

## üß™ Testing & Demo
- Unit tests for models, serializers, views, and permissions.  
- API tests using `APITestCase` with JWT authentication.  
- Tested CRUD operations for all endpoints.  
- Final demo will be presented using **Postman** to showcase endpoints in action.
